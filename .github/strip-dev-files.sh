# Runs as the build step of humanmade/hm-github-actions' build-to-release-branch action, between
# the reverse-applied merge (which leaves the index holding all of main's tree) and the

# release commit without touching the working tree, and the next run re-applies main in full
# before this script runs again, so it is idempotent.

# What to strip is decided by `git archive`, never by re-reading .gitattributes with check-attr:
# an export-ignore on a directory pattern such as `/tests` matches the directory entry alone, so
# check-attr reports nothing for the files inside it and the whole suite would ship.
# See CLAUDE.md: "The release branch is stripped, and `git archive` is what decides by how much".

# The merge has staged main's tree but not committed it, so HEAD is still the previous
# release commit. write-tree turns the index into a tree object archive can read.
